# asteroids-attempt

In a stunning departure from trying to create a website, I attempt to create a JavaScript based version of the Atari game 'asteroids'.

This is a bit of fun and a lot of practice/learning.

Following a guide called 'INTRODUCING JAVASCRIPT GAME DEVELOPMENT' written by Graeme Stuart.

Thanks for reading me! Many more updates to follow as progression continues.
